Hi there!
I've been software developer for 18 years, mainly building distributed systems in C and Python. 

I quit my job at [Proton](https://proton.me/) after 5 years to have a rest and make a career pivot into Rust.

This page tracks my progress on the journey towards getting first Rust job.

My challenge is to do something about Rust every day.

My starting point is:
* studied [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) in 2022
* skimmed [Hands-On Microservices with Rust](https://www.amazon.pl/Hands-Microservices-Rust-scalable-microservices/dp/1789342759/) in 2021
* skimmed [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in 2022

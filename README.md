Hi there!

I've been software developer for 18 years, mainly building distributed systems in C and Python. 

I quit my job at [Proton](https://proton.me/) after 5 years to have **a rest** and **make a career pivot into Rust**.

This page tracks my progress on the journey towards getting the first Rust job.

My challenge is to do something about Rust every day. My starting point is:

* studied [Programming Rust, 2nd Edition book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust-2nd/9781492052586/) in 2022
* skimmed [Hands-On Microservices with Rust](https://www.amazon.pl/Hands-Microservices-Rust-scalable-microservices/dp/1789342759/) in 2021
* skimmed [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in 2020

## February 2023

* Feb, 06: Apply for Rust Developer role at crypto/financial startup
* Feb, 07: _
* Feb, 08: Apply for C/Rust Developer role at security company
* Feb, 09: Setup [github.com/rustguy](https://github.com/rustguy)
* Feb, 10: Setup [rustguy.github.io](https://rustguy.github.io/) and [save-the-planet-with-rust](https://github.com/rustguy/save-the-planet-with-rust)
* Feb, 11: Add some content to [save-the-planet-with-rust](https://github.com/rustguy/save-the-planet-with-rust)
* Feb, 12: Research IDE for Rust. I've been **vim** user for ages but feel like I am gonna use mainly **VS** for Rust development.
* Feb, 13: Setup IDE. Learned VS shortcuts, installed Rust extension in VS and connected with [github.com/rustguy](https://github.com/rustguy)
